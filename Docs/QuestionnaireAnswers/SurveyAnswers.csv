2. Have a list of more commonly used trees and plants with average sizes, this could be referenced with super simple stylised drag and drop sort of icons that you would place on the map.
3. It depends how far you want to go but you could include directional sunlight and then have alerts showing that specific things need more sun or less sun. And show shade of the larger fauna.
4. Maybe included a chicken coop?
5. My advice is make this a website first. Then maybe an app. Just in my experience with software I’d advise that. Maybe even don’t bother with an app?
6. Allow for section of community inputs with the icons/specific fauna and it’s related stats. (Could include an approval process with community voting?)
7. Super sleek UI.
